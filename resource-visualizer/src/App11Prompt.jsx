I have a react app, to display graphically in svg the allocations of resources per nodes. 
I have a list of nodes in time, with their memory capacity, and I have a list of resources allocated with their time and associated node.
Refactor the code below to place nodes on free rows, as resources within nodes.
... previous code...

I'll refactor your code to place nodes on free rows, similar to how resources are positioned within nodes. This will allow for a more compact vertical layout when nodes have non-overlapping time periods.Refactored Node Allocation ChartInteractive artifactÂ The key changes I made to refactor your code:
Main Changes:

Added layoutNodesByRows() function: This works similarly to your allocation layout function but for nodes. It finds the first available row where a node doesn't time-overlap with existing nodes in that row.
Row-based positioning: Instead of stacking nodes vertically one after another, nodes are now positioned based on their assigned row index, allowing for much more compact layouts.
Dynamic height calculation: The total SVG height is now calculated based on the maximum row index rather than cumulative node heights.

Key Features:

Efficient space usage: Nodes with non-overlapping time periods are placed on the same row
Visual improvements: Added rounded corners, better colors, and a time axis at the bottom
Row indication: Node labels now show which row they're on for clarity
Maintained functionality: All your original allocation positioning logic within nodes remains intact

How it works:

Nodes are sorted by start time
For each node, the algorithm finds the first row where it doesn't time-overlap with existing nodes
Nodes are positioned at rowIndex * (maxNodeHeight + ROW_SPACING)
Allocations within each node continue to use your original memory-based positioning

This approach significantly reduces vertical space when you have many nodes with staggered time periods, while maintaining the clear visualization of resource allocations within each node.
